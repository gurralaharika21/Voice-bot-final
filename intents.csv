20,can we live on moon?,"though the moon has no liquid water, in 2018 nasa confirmed it does exist on the surface in ice form. ... settlers would use this water for drinking, and extract the hydrogen and oxygen for rocket fuel. and they would also save some for another key element of survival Ã¢â‚¬â€œ growing food."
